## Overview

Lucky 21 is a simple command-line-based blackjack game where players compete against a dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game features standard blackjack rules, including the handling of face cards and Aces.

## UX

### The Strategy Plane

5. Dealer draws cards based on Blackjack rules.
6. Determine the winner of the round.
7. Update and display scores.
8. Allow the player to replay or quit.
  
#### Visual Flow of Game Logic

![Flow chart](assets/logic/blackjack_game_logic_flow.png)

#### Programming Paradigm

The Lucky 21 Blackjack Game follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, focusing on:

##### Encapsulation

* Game components such as Card, Deck, Player, and BlackjackGame are encapsulated in separate classes.

* Each class handles specific functionality, ensuring a modular design.

##### Abstraction

* The game hides complex logic (e.g., card value calculations, dealer behavior) behind intuitive methods like hand_value() and add_card().

##### Inheritance

* While not extensively used in this project, the class-based structure allows for future inheritance, enabling features like multiple game modes or different types of players.

##### Polymorphism

* Polymorphic behavior is achieved through overriding methods like __str__() in the Card class to provide a custom string representation.

##### Reusability

* The modular design of classes like Deck and Player allows them to be reused or extended in other card games.

* This paradigm ensures that the game is scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand for future developers.

### The Surface Plane

#### Design

The game uses simple visual elements to display cards and game status:

### Game Rules

#### Card Values

* Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value is more advantageous for the player.
* Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) and Tens are worth 10.
* Number cards are worth their face value.

#### Gameplay Mechanics

* Each player starts with two cards.
* Players can choose to hit or stand.
* The dealer must draw until reaching a total of at least 17.
* The player wins by having a higher hand value than the dealer without exceeding 21.
* If the player or dealer exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.

#### Example Game Flow

1. The player enters their name.
2. The game displays the initial hands of the player and dealer.
3. The player decides whether to hit or stand.
4. The dealer plays according to the rules.
5. The game announces the winner or if itâ€™s a tie.

#### Updated Scoreboard

* Scores are displayed at the end of each round.
* Tie-breaking logic ensures a winner is declared when possible.

## Future Enhancements

* Multiplayer mode to allow multiple players to compete against the dealer.
* Additional visual enhancements for the card display.
* Integration of difficulty levels for the dealer's behavior.
* Web-based or graphical version of the game.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries are required; the game uses built-in libraries (`random`, `time` and `os`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

## Usage

1. Run the game by executing the script: `python run.py`.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your name and start playing.
3. Choose to hit (draw a card) or stand (keep your current hand) when prompted.

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

#### Manual Testing

* Verified the shuffle and draw mechanics to ensure randomness.
* Tested Ace value adjustment logic under various conditions.
* Checked dealer behavior to ensure it follows the rules (e.g., standing on 17).
* Validated user inputs for both valid and invalid responses (e.g., unexpected characters, numbers out of range).

#### Edge Case Testing

* Confirmed correct behavior when a player or dealer busts.
* Ensured proper handling of ties and blackjack scenarios.
* Verified handling of an empty deck in long replay sessions.

### Testing Methodology

* Ran the game with multiple rounds to observe memory management and stability.
* Input stress tests by providing rapid, random inputs to simulate unpredictable user behavior.

### Testing Results

#### Pass

* All standard game mechanics (hit, stand, dealer behavior, scoring).
* Scoreboard updates and display formatting.
* Replay functionality and exit prompts.

#### Testing Overview

##### Player Hits Blackjack on Initial Deal

* Input: No action required.s
